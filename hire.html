                  <h2>Hiring (back-end)</h2>
                  <p>We’re looking for a senior developer for a potential CTO role in the timezone UTC 0 to +5. At TULP we make a social media NFT market to push the envelope on what a social media and NFT markets are suppose to do. </p>
                  <p>This sounds like some very big unrealistic vision, but we figured out the design and functionality to make this possible. Also the timing is right, because we build on a protocol that is one of the best from a technical perspective.
